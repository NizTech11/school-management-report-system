student_pdfs = generate_individual_student_pdfs(
    selected_classes, 
    term="Term 3", 
    exam_type="End of Term"
)

# Result: Dictionary of PDFs with student-named files
# {
#   "John_Doe_Year_2_Term_3_End_of_Term.pdf": {
#       'buffer': <PDF_data>, 
#       'student': <Student_object>,
#       'class': <Class_object>,
#       'display_name': "John Doe (Year 2)"
#   },
