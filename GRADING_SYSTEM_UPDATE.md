# Updated Grading System Documentation

## Overview

The grading system has been updated to match the new percentage-based grading scale. This document outlines the changes made and the new grading structure.

## New Grading Scale

| Grade | Percentage Range | Description    |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1     | 80% - 100%      | HIGHEST        |
| 2     | 70% - 79%       | HIGHER         |
| 3     | 65% - 69%       | HIGH           |
| 4     | 60% - 64%       | HIGH AVERAGE   |
| 5     | 55% - 59%       | AVERAGE        |
| 6     | 50% - 54%       | LOW AVERAGE    |
| 7     | 45% - 49%       | LOW            |
| 8     | 35% - 44%       | LOWER          |
| 9     | 0% - 34%        | LOWEST         |

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Grade Calculation Function

**File:** `src/services/db.py`
**Function:** `calculate_grade(score: float) -> int`

**Previous Scale:**
- Grade 1: 90-100% (Excellent)
- Grade 2: 80-89% (Very Good)
- Grade 3: 70-79% (Good)
- Grade 4: 60-69% (Satisfactory)
- Grade 5: 50-59% (Fair)
- Grade 6: 40-49% (Poor)
- Grade 7: 30-39% (Very Poor)
- Grade 8: 20-29% (Weak)
- Grade 9: 0-19% (Very Weak/Failed)

**New Scale:**
- Grade 1: 80-100% (HIGHEST)
- Grade 2: 70-79% (HIGHER)
- Grade 3: 65-69% (HIGH)
- Grade 4: 60-64% (HIGH AVERAGE)
- Grade 5: 55-59% (AVERAGE)
- Grade 6: 50-54% (LOW AVERAGE)
- Grade 7: 45-49% (LOW)
- Grade 8: 35-44% (LOWER)
- Grade 9: 0-34% (LOWEST)

### 2. Updated Grade Descriptions

**File:** `src/services/db.py`
**Function:** `get_grade_description(grade: int) -> str`

All grade descriptions have been updated to match the new system with more specific performance indicators.

## Key Differences

### More Granular Upper Grades
- The new system provides more granular distinctions in the higher performance ranges
- Grade 3 now covers a smaller range (65-69%) instead of (70-79%)
- This allows for better differentiation of high-performing students

### Adjusted Failure Threshold
- The failure range (Grade 9) has been expanded to 0-34%
- This provides more realistic assessment of struggling students
- Grade 8 (LOWER) now covers 35-44%, giving more room for improvement recognition

### Updated Terminology
- Moved from subjective terms (Excellent, Good, Poor) to performance level indicators
- New terms are more descriptive of relative performance levels
- Maintains professional assessment standards

## Impact on Existing Data

- All existing student marks and grades will be automatically recalculated using the new scale
- The aggregate calculation system remains unchanged (still sums grades 1-9)
- Historical data comparisons should account for the scale change

## Testing

The updated grading system has been thoroughly tested with all percentage ranges to ensure correct grade assignment and description mapping.

**Test Results:** ✅ All tests passed successfully

## Usage Examples

```python
from services.db import calculate_grade, get_grade_description

# Example calculations
score_85 = calculate_grade(85)  # Returns: 1 (HIGHEST)
score_72 = calculate_grade(72)  # Returns: 2 (HIGHER)  
score_67 = calculate_grade(67)  # Returns: 3 (HIGH)
score_30 = calculate_grade(30)  # Returns: 9 (LOWEST)

# Get descriptions
desc_1 = get_grade_description(1)  # Returns: "HIGHEST"
desc_5 = get_grade_description(5)  # Returns: "AVERAGE"
```

## Migration

No database migration is required as the grade calculation is performed dynamically based on stored percentage scores. All existing functionality remains intact with the updated grading scale automatically applied.
