# Enhanced Score Validation Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented enhanced score validation to prevent teachers from entering invalid marks (below 0 or above 100) and provide clear error messages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Validation Function (`src/services/db.py`)
- **Modified:** `validate_and_normalize_score()` function
- **Improvements:**
  - Specific error messages for negative scores
  - Specific error messages for scores above 100%
  - Clear indication of valid range (0-100%)
  - User-friendly error descriptions

### 2. Improved Form Validation (`src/components/forms.py`)
- **Enhanced:** Marks entry form in `marks_form()` function
- **Improvements:**
  - Real-time validation with error display
  - Prevents form submission when validation fails
  - Shows specific error messages to users
  - Grade preview only for valid scores
  - Clear feedback on what went wrong

## Validation Behavior

### ✅ Valid Scores (Accepted)
- **0%** - Minimum valid score
- **0.1% to 99.9%** - Any decimal score within range
- **100%** - Maximum valid score

### ❌ Invalid Scores (Rejected with Error Messages)
- **Negative scores** (e.g., -1%, -0.5%):
  - Error: "Score cannot be negative. You entered: [score]%. Valid range: 0-100%"
- **Scores above 100%** (e.g., 101%, 150%):
  - Error: "Score cannot exceed 100%. You entered: [score]%. Valid range: 0-100%"

## User Experience Improvements

### When Teacher Enters Invalid Score:
1. **Validation runs automatically** when form is submitted
2. **Clear error message displays** explaining what went wrong
3. **Form submission is blocked** - mark is NOT saved to database
4. **Specific guidance provided** on valid score range (0-100%)
5. **Grade preview is hidden** for invalid scores

### Error Message Examples:
- For score -5%: "❌ **Mark not saved!** Score cannot be negative. You entered: -5%. Valid range: 0-100%"
- For score 110%: "❌ **Mark not saved!** Score cannot exceed 100%. You entered: 110%. Valid range: 0-100%"

## Technical Implementation

### Validation Flow:
1. Teacher enters score in number input field
2. Form validation runs when "Save Mark" is clicked
3. `validate_and_normalize_score()` checks if score is in 0-100 range
4. If invalid:
   - ValueError is raised with specific error message
   - Form displays error and prevents submission
   - Database save is prevented
5. If valid:
   - Score is saved to database
   - Grade is calculated and displayed
   - Success message shown

### Error Handling:
```python
# Validation with specific error messages
try:
    validated_score = validate_and_normalize_score(score)
except ValueError as e:
    validation_error = str(e)
    st.error(f"⚠️ **Invalid Score**: {str(e)}")
```

### Form Submission Logic:
```python
# Only save if validation passes
if submitted and subject and validated_score is not None and validation_error is None:
    # Save mark to database
elif submitted and validation_error is not None:
    # Show error message and prevent save
```

## Testing Results

All validation tests **PASSED**:
- ✅ Accepts valid scores (0-100%)
- ✅ Rejects negative scores with appropriate error
- ✅ Rejects scores above 100% with appropriate error
- ✅ Provides clear, user-friendly error messages
- ✅ Prevents invalid data from being saved to database

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity:** Prevents invalid scores in database
2. **User Guidance:** Clear error messages help teachers understand requirements
3. **System Reliability:** Robust validation prevents data corruption
4. **User Experience:** Immediate feedback without confusing technical errors
5. **Educational Standards:** Enforces standard percentage scoring (0-100%)

## Usage Instructions for Teachers

When entering marks:
1. Enter scores between 0% and 100% (inclusive)
2. If you enter a negative number, you'll see an error explaining scores cannot be negative
3. If you enter a number above 100%, you'll see an error explaining the maximum is 100%
4. Only valid scores will be saved to the system
5. The grade will only be calculated and displayed for valid scores

The system now provides complete protection against invalid score entries while maintaining a user-friendly interface.
